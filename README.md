# Matt's TypeScript Challenges

This project attempt to fill something of a hole in the materials for learning TypeScript. Namely
challenges that test your ability to write good generics, instead of merely functionality.

## How use a challenge?

1.  `yarn` in the root of the repo to install depencencies
1.  Change to the directory of your challenge
1.  Open `challenge.ts` and read the prompt
1.  Make an attempt at a solution
1.  Run `yarn check-solution`
1.  If unsuccessful, go to step 4
1.  Give yourself a pat on the back
1.  Choose the next challenge

## Layout and Difficulty Levels

If you've ever been to a North American ski resort, these might look a little familiar.

### ðŸŸ¢ Green (Easy) ðŸŸ¢

The easiest challenges are here. These focus primarily on comprehending existing generics. If they
do require that you write a generic, it will be a very simple one.

### ðŸŸ¦ Blue (Medium) ðŸŸ¦

These challenges will require you to write more difficult generics for a preexisting
implementation, inlculding mapped and conditional types.

### ![â—†](docs/images/black-diamond-with-glow.webp) Black (Hard) ![â—†](docs/images/black-diamond-with-glow.webp)

These challenges will be quite hard. The difficulty here is a little nebulous, but you should
expect to write complex types that are still within the bounds of what the type system is designed
to handle.

### ![â—†â—†](docs/images/double-black-diamond-with-glow.webp) Double Black (Very Hard) ![â—†â—†](docs/images/double-black-diamond-with-glow.webp)

Here be dragons. These will be types that require significant effort to work around the limitations
of the type system. Expect some slight sanity damage. You have been warned.
