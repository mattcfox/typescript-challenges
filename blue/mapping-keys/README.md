# Mapping keys

You will be provided with a function and an array of config settings. You will need to add types to
the function. `getConfigValues` return value will need to be an object with keys and values
corresponding to the settings array passed in, and it should require no type changes to add or
remove a setting. And example input and output type have been provided. You should make no changes
to the implementation other than adding types to `getConfigValues`.

## How to complete this challenge

1.  Open `challenge.ts`
1.  Add types to `getConfigValues` to properly represent the return type
1.  Run `yarn check-solution` in this directory
1.  If it fails, see step 2
